"# Adventure-Quest" 
This is the source code thingy for a game called Adventure Quest. This project was pretty solo, since I made all the assets and did all the programming.
PLAY IT ON NEWGROUNDS https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/795024
DOWNLOAD IT ON ITCH https://randomantionsng.itch.io/adventure-quest

## IF YOU WANT TO COMPILE THE GAME ON YOUR OWN THEN READ ON

First you're gonna have to download Haxe. I'll just copy and paste the link to the directions https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/the-power-of-haxeflixel/

I recommend using Visual Studio Code since it's so good.

After you install HaxeFlixel and VSCode, you're good.

## CONCLUSION

Once you have all that, then run lime test html5 -debug, for Windows just change to lime test windows.

Thanks for reading.
